# 🏏 IPL Analyzer Dashboard – Project Summary

Hi there! I'm Sai Kiran, and I built an **IPL Power BI Dashboard** to analyze the Indian Premier League (IPL) using interactive visuals and data storytelling.

This project helps users explore everything from **team performance** and **player stats** to **match outcomes**, **venue trends**, and even **toss decisions**. It's a full analytical dive into one of the most exciting cricket leagues in the world.

##  What This Dashboard Covers

I pulled data from a Kaggle IPL dataset and built dynamic dashboards in Power BI. Here’s what you can explore:

- Compare **teams** season by season.
- Dive into stats for **500+ batsmen**, **450+ bowlers**, and **200+ fielders**.
- Visualize how teams perform at **30+ venues**.
- Analyze **match outcomes** like wins by runs vs wickets.
- Understand how **toss decisions** affect results.
- Find **top performers** for each season.

All dashboards include filters to help you dig into data by **season**, **team**, **player**, or **venue**.
